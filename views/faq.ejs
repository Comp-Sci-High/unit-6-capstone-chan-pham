                        You can use our Alumni directory to find graduates who attended your colleges of interest. Each profile includes contact information (visible to logged-in students) and many alumni have indicated their willingness to mentor current students. Additionally, we host quarterly networking events where you can meet alumni in person.

                        Absolutely! We encourage alumni to participate in our mentorship program. You can sign up through the Alumni portal and specify your areas of expertise, availability, and preferred age groups. Mentors typically commit to at least one conversation per month with their mentees, but the specific arrangement is flexible.

If you've forgotten your login information, please use the "Forgot Password" option or contact alumni@schoolname.edu for assistance. We encourage all alumni to update their information at least once a year.

                        Yes, we offer legacy scholarships for siblings, children, and other close relatives of our alumni. The Alumni Association provides several scholarships ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 annually. Applications open each December and close in March. Visit the Scholarships section for more details and eligibility requirements.

                        Class reunions are typically held every 5 years (5th, 10th, 15th, etc.) during Homecoming weekend in October. Additionally, we host an all-class reunion every summer. Information about upcoming reunions is posted on the Events calendar and sent via email to alumni from the relevant graduating classes approximately 6 months in advance.
